# hardware-survey-script
---
A Python script for collecting hardware information from people.

Created for my school as a part of schoolwide hardware survey.


On Linux, the script requires the inxi program.

Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install inxi`

Fedora: `sudo dnf install inxi`

Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -s inxi`
